Yeomint
=======

Web interface for running [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generators

**Current Git Flow Feature**
> git flow feature finish use_of_yeomint-generator


          
## Description 

For now, all the generators depend on the [yeoman-generator](). 

[generator-ember](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember), [generator-backbone](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone), ...

```json
"dependencies": {
    "yeoman-generator": "~0.16.0",
  },
```


With Yeomint all the generators would depend on [yeomINT-generator]()

[generator-ember](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember), [generator-backbone](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone), ...

```json
"dependencies": {
    "yeomint-generator": "~0.1.0",
  },
```
